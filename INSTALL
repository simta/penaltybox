penaltybox installation
=======================


1.  Build Requirements

    Technically just a C compiler, make(1) and the MySQL libs. You'll probably
    want to be able to build simta itself too, though.  See the INSTALL file
    for simta.


2.  Configuring the source tree

    No special requirements here;  This should, but doesn't, inherit variables
    from the main simta autoconf.


3.  Building

    Simply run the command "make".


4.  Installing penaltybox/userthrottle

    penaltybox and userthrottle are designed to be invoked by simta as mail
    content filters.  Since simta invokes only one filter, a "supervisor"
    filter will be needed if multiple filters are desired.  No supervisor
    filter is provided here;  A simple shell script will suffice.  See also
    run-parts(8).

    penaltybox assumes the presence of some external test mechanism which
    will choose the messages it will be invoked upon.  This decision --
    when to greylist -- is specific to each domain.
 
    userthrottle should be invoked on all messages on the authenticated
    outbound gateways.  This is something of a misnomer as it will provide
    rate monitoring, but the actual throttle mechanism (if desired) must
    be implemented seperately.  A simple shell script query against the
    summary database should suffice.
