This directory contains the "penaltybox" and related programs.  These are
meant to be invoked from the simta content filter.  

The penaltybox program communicates with an external MySQL database
to store and query message checksums.  It uses these database records
to implement a form of mail greylisting for mail inbound to a domain.

Also included is the "userthrottle" program.  It uses a similar scheme
to monitor per-authenticated-user mail sending rates for a domain, and
optionally manage the same. 

Please note that actual database implementation details are excluded here.
MySQL client configuration, DB table definitions etc. will be specific to
your domain.



use main CHANGELOG:  feature changes / milestones
